 r_gdi_matrix_desc:0 "A fragmented war matrix from a once menacing empire. We can invest a large amount of energy to defragment the relic and gain access to their lost war ship designs, for a time."
 r_gdi_matrix_active:0 "Allows the design and construction of §PMenacing Cruisers§! for 5 years."
 gdi_arc_desc:0 "Several deep scans across this system eventually lead us to an abandoned complex buried deep under this planets surface."

 gdievent.0029.name:0 "The End of the GDI"
 gdievent.0029.desc:0 "Given the horrible state of this GDI megastructure, gaining access to the onboard datacenters was quite easy. Apparently, the giant star-encasing megastructure at the center of the system was constructed to 'duplicate' the system into every possible space and time. From the apparent state of the system though, it seems that their efforts were thwarted. Shortly after restoring power to parts of the megastructure, a new energy signature was detected aboard the structure, leading us to a failing GDI computation core. We were able to stabilize the core before it ultimately failed, and it seems to still be generating designs for new warships, mistaking us for its demented masters."
 EVENT_FOUND_GDI_RELIC:0 "What secrets might this suspiciously cute core reveal to us?"
 gdi_1_cat:0 "An Impossible Solar System"
 gdi_event_anomaly_desc:0 "System scans indicate that this systems star is too small to support the slightest bit fusion in its core, and it's first planet has an orbit well within the star's Roche Limit, investigation is required."
 gdievent.0003.name:0 "A Promising Lead"
 gdievent.0003.desc:0 "Despite the efforts of [This.GetLeaderName], we have no explanation for this system's unique traits. Extensive study of the star has given us a much deeper understanding of fusion in small stars, and deep scans of the system's first planet reveal a structure buried underneath the surface giving off faint energy signatures."
 GDI_EVENT_SPAWNARCHOLOGY:0 "Prepare an excavation team."
 gdievent.0022.name:0 "Homeworld Located!"
 gdievent.0022.desc:0 "[This.getHomeworldStatus]"
 gdievent.0022.desc.a:0 "It's worked! Using data gathered from the three materialized systems, we've managed to perform a rudimentary form of void triangulation to locate the Homeworld system. Scientists managed to pull the system out of the void with a burst of energy using the unique dark matter samples collected from each of the materialized systems. Homeworld has materialized near the point of the anniliation and seems to have settled in a stable state within our galaxy."
 gdievent.0022.desc.b:0 "We gathered all of the samples from the materialized worlds, but our scientists have not been able to pull the core GDI system out from the void. Upon further investigation, it seems that another empire beat us to the punch! The GDI home system may have already been plundered and it's secrets fallen into the wrong hands."
 EVENT_GDI_HOMEWORLD:0 "Contact the nearst science ship, we must have their secrets."

 gdievent.0035.name:0 "Strange Readings in [Root.System.GetName]"
 gdievent.0035.desc:0 "Upon entry to the [Root.System.GetName] system, [This.GetLeaderName] picked up strange readings across the entire system. The entire system weights more than it should, even the empty space has mass far exceeding what should be possible in our universe. Further investigation is required."
 COLLECT_SAMPLES:0 "Collect some samples for study. Lets also take a closer look at this system."

#EAST
 gdievent.0032.name:0 "Dark Matter Sponge"
 gdievent.0032.desc:0 "After extensive investigation on [gdi_east_project_target.GetName], we found that the brown dwarf at the center of the system absorbed most of the energy while falling into our galaxy. This gives the star strange properties, like being able to sustain fusion at it's core despite the insufficient mass to do normally. This also offers some explanation as to how its closest orbiting body can remain stable far past the stars Roche limit."
 gdi_poi_1:0 "Investigate [gdi_quest_system_east.GetName]"
 GDI_PROJECT_EAST:0 "Readings on [gdi_east_project_target.GetName]"
 GDI_PROJECT_EAST_DESC:0 "This planet is well within the Roche limit of the host star. The star is also not massive enough to sustain the small amount of fusion in its core."
#SOUTH
 gdievent.0033.name:0 "A Violent Implosion"
 gdievent.0033.desc:0 "The black hole in this system is not like the others in our galaxy. The spin, charge, and mass of this black hole are constantly changing. The mass around the accretion disk flucuates with the black hole, suggesting they are both foreign to our galaxy. The mass's orbit around the black hole also suggest that it was expelled from the center of the black hole, likely upon materializing in our galaxy. The spontanious materialization also seems to have destabilized the astral space near the edge of the system."

 GDI_PROJECT_SOUTH:0 "Readings on [gdi_south_project_target.GetName]"
 GDI_PROJECT_SOUTH_DESC:0 "The readings from the black hole and its accretion disc in this system are consistently inconsistent. The space around the black hole also seems to be unstable, we must investigate with care."
#WEST
 gdievent.0034.name:0 "A Structure From the Future"
 gdievent.0034.desc:0 "The ruined structure in the system has given us a plethora of data, both about the system's journey to our galaxy and its previous owners. Functioning instruments and black-boxes aboard the structure show that the materialized systems have fallen out of a special space between dimensions that we have dubbed 'The Void', an area where Time and Space do not seem to exist. The system also seemed to have belonged to an empire calling themselves the 'GDI', and it seems that all of these systems are actually different fragments of their home system, torn apart in their journey through the Void. It seems the inner system is still trapped in the void, out of our reach."
 gdi_poi_3:0 "Investigate [gdi_quest_system_west.GetName]"
 GDI_PROJECT_WEST:0 "Readings on [gdi_west_project_target.GetName]"
 GDI_PROJECT_WEST_DESC:0 "The ruined structure over [gdi_west_project_target.GetName] may offer insights into how these systems fell into our galaxy."
 gdi_poi:0 "This system seems to have something to do with the recent spontanious materialization of systems seem across the galaxy. Investigation is warranted."

 gdi_bystander_create_poi:0 "Time to start searching..."
 gdi_founder_create_poi:0 "We must piece together the rest of the puzzle..."
 gdievent.0006.name:0 "Spontaneous Materialization"
 gdievent.0006.desc:0 "After the strange device was activated, the entire planet shook violently before finally calming down. No damages or casualties were reported, but we are receiving foreign reports of more systems materializing from nowhere. It seems we may have inadvertantly pulled more systems into existance, further investigation is required."
 gdievent.0005.name:0 "Spontaneous Materialization"
 gdievent.0005.desc:0 "We have just recieved multiple reports of systems materializing into our galaxy from nowhere. The cause of this event is still unknown, but our most promising lead is from a large energy signature detected from a system in the galaxy moments before the first system materialized. Whether this was malicious or deliberate is yet unknown, we must investigate and prepare for any possible hostile agents."
 GET_TO_WORK:0 "Lets get to work."
 gdievent.0042.name:0 "Impossible System"
 gdievent.0042.desc:0 "This system is most interesting indeed. Initial scans reveal the host star to be too small to sustain fusion, and the closest orbiting body is too large to exist this close to the star. Care must be taken investigating so close to the host star."
 gdievent.0043.name:0 "Unstable Mass"
 gdievent.0043.desc:0 "Upon entering the system, most of the science crew immediately fell unconcious. To those still lucid, the problem was immediately apparent, it was as if they had suddenly doubled in mass. Luckily, the science vessel is strong enough to withstand the increased stress of the double mass system. Care is advised while investigating further."
 gdievent.0044.name:0 "A Tear in Time"
 gdievent.0044.desc:0 "Exiting hyperspace, the science team is immediately blinded by a flash of light coming from the structure in the system. After a brief visual inspection, it seems that the molecules of the structure are progressing rapidly back and forth through the previous states in it's history, shifting from molten metal to lumps of stone to wrecked debris with no rhyme or reason. The team must take care not to get caught up in this unique matter, lest they wish to become an experiment themselves."
 gdievent.1003.name:0 "Impossible Solar System"
 gdievent.1003.desc:0 "Immediately upon entering the solar system, [This.GetLeaderName] noticed that several things are wrong. Specifically, this system's star should not be able to sustain fusion at all, and the closest orbiting body is too close to even exist. [This.GetLeaderName] suggests we investigate further."
 gdievent.0012.name:0 "Progress Digging..."
 gdievent.0012.desc:0 "The archeology site has been established and excavation efforts are well under way. The only issue is that about half way down to the buried complex, the rock has become extremely dense, requiring more specialized equipment and care to continue."
 gdievent.digsite.0:0 "Get that equipment and continue digging!"

 gdievent.0013.name:0 "The Door"
 gdievent.0013.desc:0 "We have finally reached the site, and uncovered a large door. Despite the apparent age of the complex from what we have uncovered, the door is still the easiest place we have uncovered to get us in. We have managed to route power to the door, but it seems to require a specialized key to open. Finding this key will take some time, so we should start immediately."
 gdievent.digsite.1:0 "Get that door open!"

 gdievent.0014.name:0 "Inside the Facility"
 gdievent.0014.desc:0 "We have opened the door. The state of the interior of this complex varies from utterly decrepid to magnificently pristine. Some of the encrypted data centers could be accessed with the same key we found to open the door. From this, we have uncovered that the facility and solar system belonged to an empire once known as the GDI, and served as a key defensive point and military data center. Other than this, the excavation team has discovered a room of still functioning telemetry and diagnostic instruments. Hopefully, we can decrypt this data and learn how this system came to be in its current state."
 gdievent.digsite.2:0 "Continue decryption efforts."

 gdievent.0015.name:0 "Spatial-Temporal Anomalies"
 gdievent.0015.desc:0 "We have decrypted much of the telemetry data in the functional areas of the complex. Confusingly, the last entries of data we could understand leads us to believe that this data was collected in a distant part of the universe, located in a galaxy we believe to be too young and hostile to sustain complex life. Even more confusing is that the system contains data on our galaxy, holding data for events that have yet to happen. [This.GetLeaderName] believes the answer to this mystery is to understand the huge amount of incomprehensible data before the facility went offline."
 gdievent.digsite.3:0 "What other secrets does this place hold?"

 gdievent.0016.name:0 "The Void"
 gdievent.0016.desc:0 "Finally, [This.GetLeaderName] believes that they have made sense of the anomalous readings. By processing the data in a multi-dimensional context, the system's path through space and time can be mapped. Indeed, this system seems to have fallen back into the past, landing in our time and space. Moreso, [This.GetLeaderName] believes that the system fell through a dimension without the concepts of space or time, dubbed 'The Void' by the science team. The last few entries in the logs suggest that the complex may have made successful communications with another facility after passing into the Void."
 gdievent.digsite.4:0 "Truly magnificent."

 gdievent.0017.name:0 "Oops..."
 gdievent.0017.desc:0 "While bringing power to a new section of the complex to investigate the Void communications, an unsupervised intern had accidentally routed power to what we believed to be the main reactor room. The reactor immediately began powering up and overheating, even after power was cut. Alarms started sounding and bulkheads started closing, it is unknown when or if the reactor will explode, but that is not a chance [This.GetLeaderName] is willing to take."
 gdievent.digsite.5:0 "Evacuate!"
